# Always Deploy

After committing code changes, **always** push to the server:

1. `git add` relevant files, `git commit`, `git push origin main`
2. Run **both** deploy scripts:
   - `DEPLOY.bat` — rezvo.co.uk (directory)
   - `DEPLOY-REZVO-APP.bat` — rezvo.app (portal)

Do not skip deployment. Both domains must stay in sync.
