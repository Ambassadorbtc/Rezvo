# BL — Next 12 Hours: CSS ONLY

## Direct instruction

**Stop building new features.** The next 12 hours are **CSS ONLY**. Match the UXPilot designs.

---

## What you're working with

**Design spec folder:** `C:\Users\HP Elitebook\Downloads\uxpilot-export-Web Portal Design`

For the dashboard: **Open `5-Brand Design - Home Dashboard.html`** in a browser side-by-side with the live dashboard.

---

## What the dashboard should look like

Right now it's functional but ugly. The design has:

- **Styled KPI cards** — Icons, colour accents, clear hierarchy
- **Activity feed** — Avatars, timestamps, visual structure
- **Quick action buttons** — Hover states, clear CTAs
- **Layout** — Cream background, rounded cards, shadow depth
- **Visual hierarchy and personality** — Not a wireframe, a product

---

## The job

One styling pass turns it into something you're proud to show.

**That's the only job between now and tomorrow.**
