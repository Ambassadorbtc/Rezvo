# BL — Next 12 Hours: CSS ONLY

## You pushed markdown files. I need you to change the REACT CODE.

Open `Dashboard.jsx` and make it look like `5-Brand Design - Home Dashboard.html`. **Change the actual CSS/Tailwind classes on the components.** The HTML design file is your target — the React page is what you're editing.

**Open both side-by-side. Match them. Push when it looks right.**

## NOT documentation. CODING.

- Edit `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`
- Edit `frontend/src/components/` if needed
- Change Tailwind classes. Add icons. Add rounded corners, shadows, hover states.
- Do NOT create more .md files. Do NOT update rules. EDIT THE .JSX FILES.
